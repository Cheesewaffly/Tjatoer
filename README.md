### A Chess Variant by Cheesewaffle

##### Requirements
* Python 3.8 or above;
* Pygame module for Python.

##### Basic Usage
In the `ChessMain.pyw` file, the variable playerone is true if white is human and false if it's an AI, the variable playertwo is true if black is human and false if it's an AI;
```Java
playerone = True
playertwo = True
```
The depth of the engine can be set in the `SmartMoveFinder.py` file, it is not recommended to set it more than 2 though, if set more than 2 the engine will take an unbearably long time to calculate;
```Java
Depth = 2
```
Optionally, you can change the filetype for the `ChessMain.pyw` file from `.pyw` to `.py` to enable the console, and vice versa to disable it. And finally, run the ChessMain file to start the program.
